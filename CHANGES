- Added support for any ASCII character (ie. also non-printable) in
  the charset and regex definition, via \0(octal), \x(hex), \(decimal)

20040912/
- Added support for a user-generated charset.txt and regex.txt file
  that can be used for storing common charsets and regex's.
- Minor optimization to mod_dom.c (domino HTTP hash)

- I'm back.. ;)
- Regex's are now enumerated in order of increasing length, so
  that shorter passwords are found much faster, without having
  to 'zig-zag' through all the lenset (which is the 'natural' way
  for my algorithm..)
- A separate program, called 'regex' enumerates passwords (using
  same syntax as lcrack, ie. -s, -g, -l) and prints them on stdout.
  This program can be used stand-alone, or in combination with
  lcrack's 'stdin' mode..
- Included 'mkword' utility, which will extract words form any
  given input (stdin). Useful for creating dictionaries..

- Regex's support variable-length wildcards, so things like
  [qwas][*][0-9] will try every password starting with one of
  { q w a s }, ending with a digit, and having anything else
  in the middle (based on whatever charset/lenset has been
  specified, of course..)
- In case I didn't say it, there is a special mode, called 'stdin'
  (ie. lcrack -stdin ..) which will allow lcrack to be provided
  with passwords to try from an external program, via a pipe, eg.
  
  password_generator | lcrack -m nt4 -stdin hashes.txt
  
  This way lcrack's power can be extended arbitrarily without
  touching the code.

20030325/
- Added experimental support for regex enumeration (for use
  in brute-forcing, when you have partial knowledge of the key)
  Read README.devel.regex for more information

20030324/
- Added check for null passwords. It happens too often,
  so I had to account for that :)

20021231/
- Added SHA-1 module. Thanks to Burcin Erocal.
- Hmm, and I wish everyone a happy new year! ;)

20021216/
- Minor optimization (~ 2%) of the Lotus Domino hash calculation.

20021215/
- Bug-fix. If a password was repeated in the input file, only one
  of them was found.

20021211/
- v1.0 is finished.
- Support for Domino HTTP passwords (R4), MD4, MD5, and NT (MD4/Unicode).
